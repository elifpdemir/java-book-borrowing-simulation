# java-book-borrowing-simulation
In this example, we're simulating borrowing books efficiently by hitting up the libraries with smaller stocks.

Here's the gist of what it does:

-It keeps a list of things (in this case, Libraries).
-It sorts these libraries based on how many books they have, putting the ones with the fewest books first.
-If you need to borrow a bunch of books, it goes through the sorted list. It starts taking books from the library with the fewest, then the next fewest, and so on, until you have all the books you asked for.

So, this program pretends you're borrowing books from several libraries. It lines them up from smallest collection to biggest, and then gets the books you need starting from the smallest pile.

This basic idea – sorting things first and then dealing with them in order – is actually useful for lots of other situations, like:

Assigning seats in a movie theater.
Giving tasks to computers (starting with the least busy one).
Packing customer orders from different warehouses.
Selling event tickets section by section.
Booking appointments into available time slots.

This project is just a simple way to show how these programming ideas work in Java!
